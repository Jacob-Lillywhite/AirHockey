# Air Hockey
---
A two player game of Air Hockey. This object-oriented game features two playable paddles so you can play locally Air Hockey with your friend!
Currently this runs on an endless gameloop. Future improvements to this would probably include first to 10 and perhaps an option to play against an AI controlled paddle.
